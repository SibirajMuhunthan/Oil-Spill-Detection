# Oil-Spill-Detection
This project was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon 2024. Our team proposed a solution to detect oil spills and vessel distress in marine environments by continuously monitoring vessel behavior for anomalies.

We used the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm to detect unusual patterns, leveraging data from AIS (Automatic Identification System) and satellite APIs for real-time vessel tracking and environmental insights.

I worked on this project during my third year of Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
